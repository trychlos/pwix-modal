### 1.4.0

    Release date: 2023- 5-29

### 1.3.1

    Release date: 2023- 5-29

    - Prevent the modal dialog to override the screen width (todo #12), introducing a new dependency on pwix:layout

    Release date: 2023- 5- 2

    - mdOutsideClose parameter is renamed mdCloseByBackdrop
    - Define mdCloseByKeyboard and mdCloseByHeader parameters
    - mdSizeKey writes width and height in a single string
        
        Rationale: in the previous (erroneous) version mdSizeKey write two datas, for width and for height
        But RGPD states that user must be able to choose individual cookies in an informed manner, and:
        1) cookieManager didn't want link two datas to let the user choose the both of two, or none
        2) pwixModal didn't want write either width or height (too much work for small added value)
        so choice is taken to write both width and height in a single data - which is much more simple

### 1.2.1

    Release date: 2023- 5- 1
